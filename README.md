I had a free day, so I thought I'd mess around with the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) a bit. I've always wanted to create a really large displayed spectrograph app with easy controls for zooming in/out on specific frequency bands and controlling latency. It's also capable of flipping between linear and logarithmic plotting, which is kinda a neat feature.

Not a bad day's work for my first at bat with this API.

## TODO:

1.  Maybe fix the toolbar styling to be a bit more mobile friendly.

2.  Add a image download feature?

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo:

2.  Install dependencies:

        npm install

3.  Run webpack:

        npm start

Should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000
